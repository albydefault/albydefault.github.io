## Introduction

One-dimensional cellular automata are perhaps the simplest systems we can imagine that exhibit complex behavior. They consist merely of a line of cells, each either on or off, evolving according to fixed rules about their immediate neighbors. Rule 110 stands out among these systems - it's proven to be capable of universal computation, despite its remarkably simple rules.

## Understanding the Rules

Each cell in Rule 110 looks at itself and its two neighbors to determine its next state. The rule can be expressed as a simple lookup table:

This means that a cell's next state depends on just three bits of information - itself and its two neighbors. Yet somehow, this simple rule is sufficient for universal computation.
